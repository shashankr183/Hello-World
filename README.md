# Hello-World
Beginning of my Journey
Shashank here ,pursuing my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering.(You read the previous words right).Recently I was intrigued by Data Science and ML.Always thought them as buzzwords but when i tried to figure what these are actually,I fell in love with their amazing applications and future scope.
I hope my uncharted path (Mechanical to DS,ML etc) worth the shot.
Thank you
